## Shell Commands
Shell commands are instructions entered and executed in a command-line interface, allowing users to interact with the operating system. These commands perform various tasks such as file manipulation, program execution, system configuration, and more.

| Command | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| `ls` | List files and directories in the current directory. |
| `cp` | Copy files or directories from one location to another. |
| `mv` | Move or rename files and directories. |
| `rm` | Remove (delete) files or directories. |
| `cat` | Display the contents of a file. |

## Command Aliases

Command aliases are short names or abbreviations assigned to longer or more complex commands. They provide a convenient way to execute frequently used or lengthy commands with shorter and easier-to-remember names. Aliases enhance command-line efficiency by reducing the amount of typing required for common tasks.

| Alias  | Command | Description |
| ------ | ------ |------ |
| `cafe` | cat /dev/urandom \| hexdump \| grep "ca fe" | Searches for "ca fe" in randomly generated data from /dev/urandom. |
| `cl` | clear | Clears the terminal screen. |git
